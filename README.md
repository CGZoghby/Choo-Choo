# Choo-Choo

The idea behind this scheduler is that we use firebase call and response to create trains and update their data with simple arrival
and minutes away calculations.

Ideally, I would have figured out how to code to add in updating from the database every minute, and also how to add/remove train rows.
Both of those require my brain wrapping around targeting dynamically added DOM elements, and sorting through and updating the HTML in 
very specific table columns, or rows, respectively.

#Which my brain cannot handle. 

Just need time to focus on this project, homework can happen second to that.
